        <p>Since Grade One, my friends from Laureate International School have been like family to me. We've been through everything together, from learning our ABCs to tackling tricky math problems in Form Four. Our friendship grew stronger as we laughed, studied, and played together.

            In class, we helped each other understand tough subjects and cheered each other on during exams. The school became our second home, where we made unforgettable memories and learned important life lessons. These friends are more than just classmates—they're the ones who have been with me through it all, making school days brighter and more fun.</p>

        <p>After our graduation from Form Four in 2019, our paths diverged as some of us pursued Form Six while others ventured into universities or different paths. Despite the distances and new chapters, our friendship remained strong. We created a WhatsApp group to stay connected, sharing updates about our lives, exchanging stories, and reminiscing about our school days.

            The WhatsApp group became our virtual hangout, where we could laugh, support each other, and stay updated on each other's adventures. Even though we were scattered across different places, the bond we formed at Laureate International School continued to thrive. </p>

        <p>In 2021, I moved to another school for Form Six Advanced class, where I met a new group of friends. We lived together in the boarding house, and our teachers felt more like friends than authority figures. It was a welcoming and supportive environment where we could advise and help each other with our studies.

            Our boarding house became a hub of friendship and academic support. We spent late nights studying together, sharing notes, and discussing challenging topics. Our teachers were always there to guide us, not just academically but also as mentors and friends. </p>

        <p>After our graduation from Feza Zanzibar, our paths once again took us to different universities and even different countries. Despite the distance, our friendship continued to thrive. We made sure to stay in touch, using every means possible to keep our bond strong.

            Through social media, messaging apps, and occasional visits when we could, we maintained our connection. The memories of our time at Feza Zanzibar kept us close, and our conversations were filled with laughter, updates on our lives, and encouragement for each other's journeys.</p>
